        Dumbledore waited, but Madame Maxime did not speak, she merely glared.
        She wasn&apos;t the only one either. Snape looked furious; Karkaroff
        livid; Bagman, however, looked rather excited. &apos;Well, shall we
        crack on, then?&apos; he said, rubbing his hands together and smiling
        around the room. &apos;Got to give our champions their instructions,
        haven&apos;t we? Barty, want to do the honors?&apos; Mr. Crouch seemed
        to come out of a deep reverie. &apos;Yes,&apos; he said,
        &apos;instructions. Yes . . . the first task . . .&apos; He moved
        forward into the firelight. Close up, Harry thought he looked ill. There
        were dark shadows beneath his eyes and a thin, papery look about his
        wrinkled skin that had not been there at the Quidditch World Cup.
      </p>
      <p>
        &apos;The first task is designed to test your daring,&apos; he told
        Harry, Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor, &apos;so we are not going to be
        telling you what it is. Courage in the face of the unknown is an
        important quality in a wizard. . . very important. &apos;The first task
        will take place on November the twenty-fourth, in front of the other
        students and the panel of judges. &apos;The champions are not permitted
        to ask for or accept help of any kind from their teachers to complete
        the tasks in the tournament. The champions will face the first challenge
        armed only with their wands. They will receive information about the
        second task when the first is over. Owing to the demanding and
        time-consuming nature of the tournament, the champions are exempted from
        end-of-year tests.&apos; Mr. Crouch turned to look at Dumbledore.
        &apos;I think that&apos;s all, is it, Albus?&apos; &apos;I think
        so,&apos; said Dumbledore, who was looking at Mr. Crouch with mild
        concern. &apos;Are you sure you wouldn&apos;t like to stay at Hogwarts
        tonight, Barty?&apos; &apos;No, Dumbledore, I must get back to the
        Ministry,&apos; said Mr. Crouch. &apos;It is a very busy, very difficult
        time at the moment.... I&apos;ve left young Weatherby in charge.. . .
        Very enthusiastic. . . a little overenthusiastic, if truth be told. . .
        &apos;You&apos;ll come and have a drink before you go, at least?&apos;
        said Dumbledore. &apos;Come on, Barry, I&apos;m staying!&apos; said
        Bagman brightly. &apos;It&apos;s all happening at Hogwarts now, you
        know, much more exciting here than at the office!&apos; &apos;I think
        not, Ludo,&apos; said Crouch with a touch of his old impatience.
      </p>
      <p>
        &apos;Professor Karkaroff - Madame Maxime - a nightcap?&apos; said
        Dumbledore. But Madame Maxime had already put her arm around
        Fleur&apos;s shoulders and was leading her swiftly out of the room.
        Harry could hear them both talking very fast in French as they went off
        into the Great Hall. Karkaroff beckoned to Krum, and they, too, exited,
        though in silence. &apos;Harry, Cedric, I suggest you go up to
        bed,&apos; said Dumbledore, smiling at both of them. &apos;I am sure
        Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you, and it
        would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a
        great deal of mess and noise.&apos; Harry glanced at Cedric, who nodded,
        and they left together. The Great Hall was deserted now; the candles had
        burned low, giving the jagged smiles of the pumpkins an eerie,
        flickering quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        &apos;So,&apos; said Cedric, with a slight smile. &apos;We&apos;re
        playing against each other again!&apos; &apos;I s&apos;pose,&apos; said
        Harry. He really couldn&apos;t think of anything to say. The inside of
        his head seemed to be in complete disarray, as though his brain had been
        ransacked. &apos;So. . . tell me. . .&apos; said Cedric as they reached
        the entrance hall, which was now lit only by torches in the absence of
        the Goblet of Fire. &apos;How did you get your name in?&apos; &apos;I
        didn&apos;t,&apos; said Harry, staring up at him. &apos;I didn&apos;t
        put it in. I was telling the truth.&apos; &apos;Ah. . . okay,&apos; said
        Cedric. Harry could tell Cedric didn&apos;t believe him. &apos;Well . .
        . see you, then.&apos; Instead of going up the marble staircase, Cedric
        headed for a door to its right. Harry stood listening to him going down
        the stone steps beyond it, then, slowly, he started to climb the marble
        ones. Was anyone except Ron and Hermione going to believe him, or would
        they all think he&apos;d put himself in for the tournament? Yet how
        could anyone think that, when he was facing competitors who&apos;d had
        three years&apos; more magical education than he had - when he was now
        facing tasks that not only sounded very dangerous, but which were to be
        performed in front of hundreds of people? Yes, he&apos;d thought about
        it. . . he&apos;d fantasized about it.. . but it had been a joke,
        really, an idle sort of dream. . . he&apos;d never really, seriously
        considered entering. . But someone else had considered it. . . someone
        else had wanted him in the tournament, and had made sure he was entered.
        Why? To give him a treat? He didn&apos;t think so, somehow... To see him
        make a fool of himself? Well, they were likely to get their wish. . But
        to get him killed? Was Moody just being his usual paranoid self?
        Couldn&apos;t someone have put Harry&apos;s name in the goblet as a
        trick, a practical joke? Did anyone really want him dead? Harry was able
        to answer that at once. Yes, someone wanted him dead, someone had wanted
        him dead ever since he had been a year old. . . Lord Voldemort. But how
        could Voldemort have ensured that Harry&apos;s name got into the Goblet
        of Fire? Voldemort was supposed to be far away, in some distant country,
        in hiding, alone. . . feeble and powerless.... Yet in that dream he had
        had, just before he had awoken with his scar hurting, Voldemort had not
        been alone. . . he had been talking to Wormtail.. . plotting
        Harry&apos;s murder. Harry got a shock to find himself facing the Fat
        Lady already. He had barely noticed where his feet were carrying him. It
        was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame. The
        wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbor&apos;s painting when he
        had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the
        Fat Lady. She must have dashed through every picture lining seven
        staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were
        looking down at him with the keenest interest. &apos;Well, well,
        well,&apos; said the Fat Lady, &apos;Violet&apos;s just told me
        everything. Who&apos;s just been chosen as school champion, then?&apos;
        &apos;Balderdash,&apos; said Harry dully. &apos;It most certainly
        isn&apos;t!&apos; said the pale witch indignantly. &apos;No, no, Vi,
        it&apos;s the password,&apos; said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she
        swung forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room. The blast
        of noise that met Harry&apos;s ears when the portrait opened almost
        knocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside
        the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the
        whole of Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and
        whistling. &apos;You should&apos;ve told us you&apos;d entered!&apos;
        bellowed Fred; he looked half annoyed, half deeply impressed. &apos;How
        did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!&apos; roared George.
        &apos;I didn&apos;t,&apos; Harry said. &apos;I don&apos;t know how
        -&apos; But Angelina had now swooped down upon him; &apos;Oh if it
        couldn&apos;t be me, at least it&apos;s a Gryffindor -&apos;
        &apos;You&apos;ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch
        match, Harry!&apos; shrieked Katie Bell, another of the Gryffindor
        Chasers. &apos;We&apos;ve got food, Harry, come and have some -&apos;
        &apos;I&apos;m not hungry, I had enough at the feast -&apos; But nobody
        wanted to hear that he wasn&apos;t hungry; nobody wanted to hear that he
        hadn&apos;t put his name in the goblet; not one single person seemed to
        have noticed that he wasn&apos;t at all in the mood to celebrate. . . .
        Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he
        insisted on draping it around Harry like a cloak. Harry couldn&apos;t
        get away; whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the
        dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks, forcing another
        butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands. . . .
        Everyone wanted to know how he had done it, how he had tricked
        Dumbledore&apos;s Age Line and managed to get his name into the
        goblet.... &apos;I didn&apos;t,&apos; he said, over and over again,
        &apos;I don&apos;t know how it happened.&apos; But for all the notice
        anyone took, he might just as well not have answered at all.
        &apos;I&apos;m tired!&apos; he bellowed finally, after nearly half an
        hour. &apos;No, seriously, George - I&apos;m going to bed -&apos; He
        wanted more than anything to find Ron and Hermione, to find a bit of
        sanity, but neither of them seemed to be in the common room. Insisting
        that he needed to sleep, and almost flattening the little Creevey
        brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the foot of the stairs,
        Harry managed to shake everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as
        fast as he could. To his great relief, he found Ron was lying on his bed
        in the otherwise empty dormitory, still fully dressed. He looked up when
        Harry slammed the door behind him. &apos;Where&apos;ve you been?&apos;
        Harry said. &apos;Oh hello,&apos; said Ron. He was grinning, but it was
        a very odd, strained sort of grin. Harry suddenly became aware that he
        was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee had tied around
        him. He hastened to take it off, but it was knotted very tightly. Ron
        lay on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.
        &apos;So,&apos; he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and
        thrown it into a corner. &apos;Congratulations.&apos; &apos;What
        d&apos;you mean, congratulations?&apos; said Harry, staring at Ron.
        There was definitely something wrong with the way Ron was smiling: It
        was more like a grimace. &apos;Well. . . no one else got across the Age
        Line,&apos; said Ron. &apos;Not even Fred and George. What did you use -
        the Invisibility Cloak?&apos; &apos;The Invisibility Cloak wouldn&apos;t
        have got me over that line,&apos; said Harry slowly. &apos;Oh
        right,&apos; said Ron. &apos;I thought you might&apos;ve told me if it
        was the cloak. . . because it would&apos;ve covered both of us,
        wouldn&apos;t it? But you found another way, did you?&apos;
        &apos;Listen,&apos; said Harry, &apos;I didn&apos;t put my name in that
        goblet. Someone else must&apos;ve done it.&apos; Ron raised his
        eyebrows. &apos;What would they do that for?&apos; &apos;I dunno,&apos;
        said Harry. He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, &apos;To
        kill me.&apos; Ron&apos;s eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger
        of disappearing into his hair. &apos;It&apos;s okay, you know, you can
        tell me the truth,&apos; he said. &apos;If you don&apos;t want everyone
        else to know, fine, but I don&apos;t know why you&apos;re bothering to
        lie, you didn&apos;t get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of
        the Fat Lady&apos;s, that Violet, she&apos;s already told us all
        Dumbledore&apos;s letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize money,
        eh? And you don&apos;t have to do end-of-year tests either. . .&apos;
        &apos;I didn&apos;t put my name in that goblet!&apos; said Harry,
        starting to feel angry. &apos;Yeah, okay,&apos; said Ron, in exactly the
        same sceptical tone as Cedric. &apos;Only you said this morning
        you&apos;d have done it last night, and no one would&apos;ve seen you..
        . . I&apos;m not stupid, you know.&apos; &apos;You&apos;re doing a
        really good impression of it,&apos; Harry snapped. &apos;Yeah?&apos;
        said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his
        face now. &apos;You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect you&apos;ll need
        to be up early tomorrow for a photo-call or something.&apos; He wrenched
        the hangings shut around his four-poster, leaving Harry standing there
        by the door, staring at the dark red velvet curtains, now hiding one of
        the few people he had been sure would believe him. When Harry woke up on
        Sunday morning, it took him a moment to remember why he felt so
        miserable and worried. Then the memory of the previous night rolled over
        him. He sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own four-poster,
        intending to talk to Ron, to force Ron to believe him - only to find
        that Ron&apos;s bed was empty; he had obviously gone down to breakfast.
        Harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room.
        The moment he appeared, the people who had already finished breakfast
        broke into applause again. The prospect of going down into the Great
        Hall and facing the rest of the Gryffindors, all treating him like some
        sort of hero, was not inviting; it was that, however, or stay here and
        allow himself to be cornered by the Creevey brothers, who were both
        beckoning frantically to him to join them. He walked resolutely over to
        the portrait hole, pushed it open, climbed out of it, and found himself
        face-to-face with Hermione. &apos;Hello,&apos; she said, holding up a
        stack of toast, which she was carrying in a napkin. &apos;I brought you
        this. . . . Want to go for a walk?&apos; &apos;Good idea,&apos; said
        Harry gratefully. They went downstairs, crossed the entrance hall
        quickly without looking in at the Great Hall, and were soon striding
        across the lawn toward the lake, where the Durmstrang ship was moored,
        reflected blackly in the water. It was a chilly morning, and they kept
        moving, munching their toast, as Harry told Hermione exactly what had
        happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night before. To his
        immense relief, Hermione accepted his story without question.
        &apos;Well, of course I knew you hadn&apos;t entered yourself,&apos; she
        said when he&apos;d finished telling her about the scene in the chamber
        off the Hall. &apos;The look on your face when Dumbledore read out your
        name! But the question is, who did put it in? Because Moody&apos;s
        right, Harry... I don&apos;t think any student could have done it. . .
        they&apos;d never be able to fool the Goblet, or get over
        Dumbledore&apos;s -&apos; &apos;Have you seen Ron?&apos; Harry
        interrupted. Hermione hesitated. &apos;Erm. . . yes. . . he was at
        breakfast,&apos; she said. &apos;Does he still think I entered
        myself?&apos; &apos;Well. . . no, I don&apos;t think so . . . not
        really,&apos; said Hermione awkwardly. &apos;What&apos;s that supposed
        to mean, &apos;not really&apos;?&apos; &apos;Oh Harry, isn&apos;t it
        obvious?&apos; Hermione said despairingly. &apos;He&apos;s
        jealous!&apos; &apos;Jealous?&apos; Harry said incredulously.
        &apos;Jealous of what? He wants to make a prat of himself in front of
        the whole school, does he?&apos; &apos;Look,&apos; said Hermione
        patiently, &apos;it&apos;s always you who gets all the attention, you
        know it is. I know it&apos;s not your fault,&apos; she added quickly,
        seeing Harry open his mouth furiously. &apos;I know you don&apos;t ask
        for it.. . but - well - you know, Ron&apos;s got all those brothers to
        compete against at home, and you&apos;re his best friend, and
        you&apos;re really famous - he&apos;s always shunted to one side
        whenever people see you, and he puts up with it, and he never mentions
        it, but I suppose this is just one time too many. . . &apos;Great,&apos;
        said Harry bitterly. &apos;Really great. Tell him from me I&apos;ll swap
        any time he wants. Tell him from me he&apos;s welcome to it.... People
        gawping at my forehead everywhere I go. . .&apos; &apos;I&apos;m not
        teiling him anything,&apos; Hermione said shortly. &apos;Tell him
        yourself. It&apos;s the only way to sort this out.&apos; &apos;I&apos;m
        not running around after him trying to make him grow up!&apos; Harry
        said, so loudly that several owls in a nearby tree took flight in alarm.
        &apos;Maybe he&apos;ll believe I&apos;m not enjoying myself once
        I&apos;ve got my neck broken or -&apos; &apos;That&apos;s not
        funny,&apos; said Hermione quietly. &apos;That&apos;s not funny at
        all.&apos; She looked extremely anxious. &apos;Harry, I&apos;ve been
        thinking - you know what we&apos;ve got to do, don&apos;t you? Straight
        away, the moment we get back to the castle?&apos; &apos;Yeah, give Ron a
        good kick up the -&apos; &apos;Write to Sirius. You&apos;ve got to tell
        him what&apos;s happened. He asked you to keep him posted on everything
        that&apos;s going on at Hogwarts. . . . It&apos;s almost as if he
        expected something like this to happen. I brought some parchment and a
        quill out with me -&apos; &apos;Come off it,&apos; said Harry, looking
        around to check that they couldn&apos;t be overheard, but the grounds
        were quite deserted. &apos;He came back to the country just because my
        scar twinged. He&apos;ll probably come bursting right into the castle if
        I tell him someone&apos;s entered me in the Triwizard Tournament -&apos;
        &apos;He&apos;d want you to tell him,&apos; said Hermione sternly.
        &apos;He&apos;s going to find out anyway.&apos; &apos;How?&apos;
        &apos;Harry, this isn&apos;t going to be kept quiet,&apos; said
        Hermione, very seriously. &apos;This tournament&apos;s famous, and
        you&apos;re famous. I&apos;ll be really surprised if there isn&apos;t
        anything in the Daily Prophet about you competing. . . . You&apos;re
        already in half the books about You-Know-Who, you know.. . and Sirius
        would rather hear it from you, I know he would.&apos; &apos;Okay, okay,
        I&apos;ll write to him,&apos; said Harry, throwing his last piece of
        toast into the lake. They both stood and watched it floating there for a
        moment, before a large tentacle rose out of the water and scooped it
        beneath the surface. Then they returned to the castle. &apos;Whose owl
        am I going to use?&apos; Harry said as they climbed the stairs. &apos;He
        told me not to use Hedwig again.&apos; &apos;Ask Ron if you can borrow
        -&apos; &apos;I&apos;m not asking Ron for anything,&apos; Harry said
        flatly. &apos;Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use
        them,&apos; said Hermione. They went up to the Owlery. Hermione gave
        Harry a piece of parchment, a quill, and a bottle of ink, then strolled
        around the long lines of perches, looking at all the different owls,
        while Harry sat down against a wall and wrote his letter. Dear Sirius,
        You told me to keep you posted on what&apos;s happening at Hogwarts, so
        here goes - I don&apos;t know if you&apos;ve heard, but the Triwizard
        Tournament&apos;s happening this year and on Saturday night I got picked
        as a fourth champion. I don&apos;t who put my name in the Goblet of
        Fire, because I didn&apos;t. The other Hogwarts champion is Cedric
        Diggory, from Hufflepuff He paused at this point, thinking. He had an
        urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to
        have settled inside his chest since last night, but he couldn&apos;t
        think how to translate this into words, so he simply dipped his quill
        back into the ink bottle and wrote, Hope you&apos;re okay, and Buckbeak
        - Harry &apos;Finished,&apos; he told Hermione, getting to his feet and
        brushing straw off his robes. At this, Hedwig fluttered down onto his
        shoulder and held out her leg. &apos;I can&apos;t use you,&apos; Harry
        told her, looking around for the school owls. &apos;I&apos;ve got to use
        one of these.&apos; Hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so
        suddenly that her talons cut into his shoulder. She kept her back to
        Harry all the time he was tying his letter to the leg of a large barn
        owl. When the barn owl had flown off, Harry reached out to stroke
        Hedwig, but she clicked her beak furiously and soared up into the
        rafters out of reach. &apos;First Ron, then you,&apos; Harry said
        angrily. &apos;This isn&apos;t my fault.&apos; If Harry had thought that
        matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of him being
        champion, the following day showed him how mistaken he was. He could no
        longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at lessons - and it
        was clear that the rest of the school, just like the Gryffindors,
        thought Harry had entered himself for the tournament. Unlike the
        Gryffindors, however, they did not seem impressed. The Hufflepuffs, who
        were usually on excellent terms with the Gryffindors, had turned
        remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them. One Herbology lesson was
        enough to demonstrate this. It was plain that the Hufflepuffs felt that
        Harry had stolen their champion&apos;s glory; a feeling exacerbated,
        perhaps, by the fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory,
        and that Cedric was one of the few who had ever given them any, having
        beaten Gryffindor once at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin
        FinchFletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very well, did not talk
        to him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray -
        though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs
        wriggled free from Harry&apos;s grip and smacked him hard in the face.
        Ron wasn&apos;t talking to Harry either. Hermione sat between them,
        making very forced conversation, but though both answered her normally,
        they avoided making eye contact with each other. Harry thought even
        Professor Sprout seemed distant with him - but then, she was Head of
        Hufflepuff House. He would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid
        under normal circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing
        the Slytherins too - the first time he would come face-to-face with them
        since becoming champion. Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid&apos;s
        cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in place. &apos;Ah, look, boys,
        it&apos;s the champion,&apos; he said to Crabbe and Goyle the moment he
        got within earshot of Harry. &apos;Got your autograph books? Better get
        a signature now, because I doubt he&apos;s going to be around much
        longer. . . . Half the Triwizard champions have died.. . how long
        d&apos;you reckon you&apos;re going to last, Potter? Ten minutes into
        the first task&apos;s my bet.&apos; Crabbe and Goyle guffawed
        sycophantically, but Malfoy had to stop there, because Hagrid emerged
        from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower of crates, each
        containing a very large Blast-Ended Skrewt. To the class&apos;s horror,
        Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing
        one another was an excess of pent-up energy, and that the solution would
        be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short
        walk. The only good thing about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy
        completely. &apos;Take this thing for a walk?&apos; he repeated in
        disgust, staring into one of the boxes. &apos;And where exactly are we
        supposed to fix the leash? Around the sting, the blasting end, or the
        sucker?&apos; &apos;Roun&apos; the middle,&apos; said Hagrid,
        demonstrating. &apos;Er - yeh might want ter put on yer dragon-hide
        gloves, jus&apos; as an extra precaution, like. Harry - you come here
        an&apos; help me with this big one.... Hagrid&apos;s real intention,
        however, was totalk to Harry away from the rest of the class. He waited
        until everyone else had set off with their skrewts, then turned to Harry
        and said, very seriously, &apos;So - yer competin&apos;, Harry. In the
        tournament. School champion.&apos; &apos;One of the champions,&apos;
        Harry corrected him. Hagrid&apos;s beetle-black eyes looked very anxious
        under his wild eyebrows. &apos;No idea who put yeh in fer it,
        Harry?&apos;
